//! The Anchor role: long-term keys and the two signing steps.
//!
//! The Anchor is stateless until it receives a [`SignatureRequest`]; from
//! there its half of issuance is a two-step state machine:
//!
//! ```text
//! (receive SignatureRequest)
//! SignatureRequest::sign          ⇒ (Signature ─▶ Client, AnchorNeedsProofRequest)
//! (receive ProofRequest)
//! AnchorNeedsProofRequest::prove  ⇒ Proof ─▶ Client
//! ```
//!
//! The Anchor never sees the unblinded nullifier `Y`, the rerandomised
//! statement `(X_hat, Z_hat)`, or the untwisted challenge `e` — only the blinded
//! `Y' = v·Y` and the twisted `e' = ε·α⁻¹·γ·e`. It *does* learn the endorsement
//! context (public metadata), which it needs to derive the context-bound
//! Pedersen generator `H` when forming `C'`.
