//! Corner-case and adversarial tests for the `1`-of-`n` OR-proof.
//!
//! `protocol.rs` covers the OR-proof's completeness and honest-prover soundness
//! (right/wrong witness, non-member statement). This file targets the boundaries
//! and the checks `OrProof::verify` performs directly: its reject guards (empty
//! set, transcript-count mismatch), degenerate sizes (`n = 1`, duplicate keys),
//! the `prove` preconditions, per-transcript tampering, and a no-witness
//! challenge-splitting forgery.
//!
//! Because `OrProof`/`Transcript` expose public fields, the adversarial tests
//! hand-craft proofs rather than only running the honest prover — that is the
//! only way to exercise `verify`'s two lines of defence (`Σ cⱼ == c` and every
//! branch's `sⱼ·Bⱼ == tⱼ + cⱼ·X_hat`) against malicious input.
